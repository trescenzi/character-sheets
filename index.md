### Backstory in 200 words

Darb's father, Groth a full orc, was a cleric of Pelor. Having originally "moved" to the city as a child
slave after the war, Groth turned out to be favored of the god and was allowed
to learn the ways of the clergy. Before becoming celibate he fathered Darb.
Having spent some amount of time as a slave Groth instilled a deep hatred of
virtually everything into Darb. Darb grew up as a clerk of the church but when
he was old enough to hold a weapon he began to be thought how to be a paladin.
Like his father he was favored of Pelor, however he didn't show much aptitude
for the life of a paladin. Instead he was trained as a member of a group of
horizon walkers, or defenders of this plane. Spirithammer set this group up
about 50 years after the war in order to provide protection against the possible
extraplanar threats. For all intents and purposes they are over trained and over
armed exorcists. Darb, now 35, is the head of the horizon walkers and as such
sometimes has the privilege of accompanying a party outside of the city in the
official outfit of the church.
